## App Overview and Objectives
A simple, personal cloud storage mobile app for Android, designed to store, organize, and search files with a modern, user-friendly interface. The goal is to provide a lightweight, functional tool for individual use with easy file management.

## Target Audience
- Personal use (single user: the developer).

## Core Features and Functionality
- **Upload**: Upload files of varying sizes (small files and large media).
- **Folder Creation**: Organize files into custom folders.
- **Search Bar**: Quickly locate files or folders by name.
- Minimalist feature set for simplicity and ease of use.

## High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations
- **Frontend**: React Native Expo
  - *Pros*: Cross-platform potential, rapid development, built-in tools for mobile.
  - *Cons*: Limited native performance for complex apps (not a concern here).
  - *Why*: Ideal for quick setup and Android focus with a modern UI.
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 with AWS S3 SDK
  - *Pros*: Cost-effective, S3-compatible, scalable storage.
  - *Cons*: Requires API integration, potential latency for large uploads.
  - *Why*: Affordable and reliable for personal cloud storage needs.
- **Authentication**: Pre-defined credentials (username: "admin", password: "123456")
  - *Pros*: Simple to implement initially.
  - *Cons*: Not secure for long-term use; plan to upgrade later.

## Conceptual Data Model
- **Files**: Metadata (name, size, upload date, file type) + binary data stored in Cloudflare R2.
- **Folders**: Simple hierarchy (name, parent folder ID, creation date).
- Stored via Cloudflare R2 buckets with a flat structure, using folder prefixes for organization.

## User Interface Design Principles
- **Color Scheme**: Black, white, and blue for a modern, professional look.
- **Layout**: Clean and minimalâ€”home screen with file/folder list, upload button, and search bar.
- **UX Goals**: Intuitive navigation, fast access to core features, uncluttered design.

## Security Considerations
- Initial static auth (admin/123456) for simplicity; plan to add proper authentication (e.g., OAuth, password hashing) later.
- Encrypt sensitive files in transit to Cloudflare R2 (SSL/TLS via AWS S3 SDK).
- Limit app access to a single Android device for personal use.

## Development Phases or Milestones
1. **Phase 1**: Set up React Native Expo project, basic UI, and static auth.
2. **Phase 2**: Integrate Cloudflare R2 with AWS S3 SDK for file uploads.
3. **Phase 3**: Add folder creation and search functionality.
4. **Phase 4**: Polish UI with black/white/blue theme and test on Android.
5. **Phase 5**: Deploy and refine based on personal use feedback.

## Potential Challenges and Solutions
- **Large File Uploads**: Slow uploads possible; optimize with chunked uploads if needed.
- **Search Performance**: Simple string matching initially; consider indexing if file count grows.
- **Security**: Static credentials are a risk; plan for secure auth upgrade in future.

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- Add analytics to track storage usage.
- Integrate push notifications for upload confirmations.
- Expand to iOS if personal needs evolve.
- Enhance security with multi-factor authentication.
